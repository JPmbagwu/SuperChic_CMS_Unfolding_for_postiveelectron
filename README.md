# SuperChic_CMS_Unfolding_for_postiveelectron

# This repository contains the full workflow for the γγ → e⁺e⁻ (photon–photon to electron–positron) analysis within the CMS experiment, utilizing SuperChic for event generation and CMS Unfolding frameworks for detector-level corrections and comparison to theoretical predictions.

# The analysis focuses on exclusive and semi-exclusive dilepton production via photon-photon fusion, an important Standard Model process sensitive to QED effects, proton structure, and central exclusive production mechanisms.
